                Fictional Privacy Policy for Coursework Purposes
(Version 1.0 – For Educational Use Only)
This privacy policy outlines the fictional data processing practices of "Coursework Project Inc." as required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for an academic assignment.
1. Identity of the Data Controller
The fictional data controller for this coursework exercise is:
Coursework Project Inc.
[Fictional Address: 123 University Ave, Academia City, AC 54321]
[Fictional Email: privacy@coursework-project.edu]
[Fictional DPO Contact: dpo@coursework-project.edu]
2. The Data We Fictitiously Process
We pretend to collect the following categories of personal data:

    Identification Data: Fictional names and student IDs.
    Contact Data: Fictional email addresses and imaginary phone numbers.
    Usage Data: Fictional IP addresses and mock browsing session information.

3. Fictional Purposes and Legal Basis for Processing
We process this imaginary data based on the following mock legal bases:
Purpose of Processing	Fictional Legal Basis (GDPR Art. 6)
To provide our fictional online services	Performance of a Contract
To send imaginary marketing emails	Consent of the data subject
To analyze mock website traffic	Legitimate Interests (improving the fictional website)
4. Fictional Data Recipients
We do not actually share your data, but in this scenario, we would transfer data to fictional cloud hosting providers and imaginary analytics platforms.
5. Fictional Data Retention
We would retain your fictional data for the duration of the coursework project, after which it would be "deleted" from our mock database.
6. Your Fictional Data Protection Rights
Under the GDPR, you would have the right to request access to your fictional data, correct it, erase it, restrict its processing, or object to its processing. Since this is a class project, these rights are purely theoretical.
7. Right to Complain
If this were real life, you would have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, such as the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in the UK.
